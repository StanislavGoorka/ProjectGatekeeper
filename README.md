# ProjectGatekeeper



An educational cybersecurity project that provides a client-side anti-cheat program that detects bots that can be used to cheat in single-player and online games.
The project also includes a simple bot for the online game Metin2, which is detected and blocked by the anti-cheat.
This particular game was chosen because of the many repetitive actions included in the game loop that can be easily macroed.



For now repo contains only bot files **WHICH ARE NOT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THE PROJECT**.

Anti-cheat files will be added later.


**I strongly discourage anyone from using included bot as a standalone software as in most games this is considered cheating and may result in a permanent ban.**

**I take no responsibility for using given bot in any game including Metin2.**
